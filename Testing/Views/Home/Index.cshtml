        POWER TO THE PLAYER:
        MyGolfSpy is on the verge of something groundbreaking. As we speak, golf companies are in control. They have become more about
        marketing than the actual performance of their products. The golfer has been forgotten about. They have put profits over the player.
        MyGolfSpy is about to put you back in control. 100% of golfers will finally be able to reach their games full potential. This way information
        really is power and distance and accuracy. Our new system is based on truth not hype. Performance not marketing.
